# 📋 EXECUTION SUMMARY & COMPLETION REPORT

## Mission Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## 🔍 Problem Investigation

### Issue Discovered
The quantum mechanics solver was producing **negative eigenvalues** and massively incorrect magnitudes:
- Expected: E₁ = 1.234
- Got: E₁ = -11.005
- Error: 992%+ 🔴

### Root Cause Analysis
Located in `src/quantum_playground/solvers.py`, line ~43:
```python
coeff = hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)  # ❌ WRONG SIGN
```

This created:
- T = (+ℏ²/2m) × (d²/dx²) — Incorrect!
- Hamiltonian eigenvalues inverted
- Physics completely broken

### Diagnostic Process
1. ✓ Created debug test to isolate problem
2. ✓ Tested kinetic energy matrix in isolation
3. ✓ Identified sign convention issue
4. ✓ Verified fix with two numerical methods
5. ✓ Confirmed all four systems now working

---

## ✅ Solution Implementation

### Code Change
**File**: `src/quantum_playground/solvers.py`  
**Line**: ~43  
**Change**: One character (added minus sign)

```python
# Before (WRONG):
coeff = hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)

# After (CORRECT):
coeff = -hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)
```

### Physical Interpretation
Now correctly computes:
- T = (-ℏ²/2m) × (d²/dx²) = (+ℏ²/2m) × (-d²/dx²) ✓
- Kinetic energy operator is positive definite ✓
- Eigenvalues represent actual particle energies ✓
