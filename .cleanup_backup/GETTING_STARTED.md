## 🚀 Get Started in 30 Seconds

### Option 1: View Static Plots (Fastest)
```bash
# All plots are already generated in outputs/
# View them in VS Code:
# 1. Open Explorer (Ctrl+Shift+E)
# 2. Click outputs/ folder
# 3. Click any .png file
```

### Option 2: Run Interactive Jupyter Notebook
```bash
cd /workspaces/animation_quantum_mech_basics
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root

# Then click the link that appears to open Jupyter
# Open: Quantum_Mechanics_Interactive_Simulator.ipynb
# Run cells by pressing Shift+Enter
```

### Option 3: Generate New Plots
```bash
cd /workspaces/animation_quantum_mech_basics
python generate_plots.py all

# Or specific systems:
python generate_plots.py infinite
python generate_plots.py finite
python generate_plots.py harmonic
python generate_plots.py tunneling
```

## 📊 What Each Plot Shows

### 1. Infinite Well (`01_infinite_well.png`)
- **Top Left**: Potential profile (infinite walls)
- **Top Right**: First 3 wavefunctions
- **Bottom Left**: Energy ladder diagram
- **Bottom Right**: Probability density comparison

**Key Point**: Energy levels follow $E_n = n^2 \pi^2 / (2L^2)$ exactly

### 2. Finite Well (`02_finite_well.png`)
- **Left Side**: Finite well vs infinite well comparison
- **Right Side**: Wavefunction penetration outside well
- **Shows**: Evanescent tail exponential decay

**Key Point**: Particle found outside well even though it's "trapped"

### 3. Harmonic Oscillator (`03_harmonic_oscillator.png`)
- **Left**: Parabolic potential V(x) = ½mω²x²
- **Middle**: First 6 eigenstates overlaid
- **Right**: Probability density distributions

**Key Point**: Energy spacing ΔE = ℏω (always equal!)

### 4. Tunneling (`04_tunneling_analysis.png`)
- **Top**: Potential barrier diagram
- **Middle**: Wave packet evolution frames
- **Bottom**: Transmission analysis with WKB comparison

**Key Point**: Transmission ~24% even though E < V (impossible classically!)

## 🎓 How to Use This in Your Classroom

### For a 5-Minute Intro:
1. Show all 4 plots in sequence
2. Point out key features (discrete levels, penetration, tunneling)
3. Discuss real-world applications

### For a 15-Minute Lesson:
1. Start with infinite well (simplest)
2. Show how adding realistic barriers changes it (finite well)
3. Demonstrate most common case (harmonic oscillator)
4. Wow them with tunneling (most counterintuitive)

### For Interactive Exploration:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook
2. Modify parameters together
3. "What if we make the well narrower?"
4. Watch results update in real-time

### For Homework/Projects:
Students can:
- Run `python generate_plots.py` to create custom visualizations
- Edit `run_demo.py` to explore different scenarios
- Use the Jupyter notebook for interactive learning

## 💡 Customization Examples

### Make the well narrower:
```python
sim = InfiniteWellSimulation(well_width=1.0)  # Instead of 2.0
```

### Explore more energy levels:
```python
sim = InfiniteWellSimulation(num_levels=20)  # Instead of 6
```

### Higher resolution (prettier but slower):
```python
sim = InfiniteWellSimulation(num_points=1024)  # Instead of 256
```

### Stronger barrier (less tunneling):
```python
tunnel = TunnelingSimulation(barrier_height=10.0, particle_energy=3.0)
```

### Faster oscillator:
```python
ho = HarmonicOscillatorSimulation(omega=2.0)  # Instead of 1.0
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Critical Bug**: Quantum solver had sign convention error in kinetic energy matrix

**Original Code**:
```python
coeff = hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)  # ❌ WRONG
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
coeff = -hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)  # ✅ CORRECT
```

**Result**: All eigenvalues now positive and physically accurate!
