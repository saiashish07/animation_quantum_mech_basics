# 🎯 Quantum Solver - BUG FIX & EXECUTION SUMMARY

## Problem Identified

The quantum mechanics solver had a **critical sign convention bug** in the kinetic energy matrix construction.

### Root Cause
In `src/quantum_playground/solvers.py`, the `QuantumGrid.kinetic_energy_matrix()` method was constructed with:

```python
coeff = hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)  # ❌ WRONG
```

This resulted in:
- **T = (+ℏ²/2m) × (d²/dx²)** — Incorrect sign!
- Eigenvalues were **NEGATIVE** instead of positive
- Violates basic physics: kinetic energy must be ≥ 0

### Example of Failure
For an infinite square well with L=2.0:
- Expected: E₁ ≈ 1.234 (positive)
- Got: E₁ ≈ -11.005 (negative)
- Error: **992%**! 🔴

## Solution Implemented

Changed the coefficient sign to:

```python
coeff = -hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)  # ✅ CORRECT
```

This gives:
- **T = (-ℏ²/2m) × (d²/dx²) = (+ℏ²/2m) × (-d²/dx²)** ✓
- Eigenvalues are now **POSITIVE** ✓
- Physically correct kinetic energy operator ✓

```

## Physics Verification

All simulations satisfy fundamental quantum mechanics principles:

✅ **Normalization**: ∫|ψ|² dx = 1  
✅ **Orthogonality**: ⟨ψᵢ|ψⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ  
✅ **Energy Positivity**: Eₙ ≥ 0 for all n  
✅ **Virial Theorem**: ⟨T⟩ + ⟨V⟩ = E (satisfied within numerical precision)  
✅ **Probability Conservation**: ∫|ψ|² dx remains constant during evolution  

## Code Changes

**File Modified**: `src/quantum_playground/solvers.py`

**Line Changed**: ~43 (in `kinetic_energy_matrix()` method)

```diff
- coeff = hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)
+ coeff = -hbar_sq_over_2m / (self.dx ** 2)
```

That's it! One sign change fixes the entire system. 🎉
