# 🚀 QUANTUM MECHANICS SIMULATION SUITE
## Complete Status & Getting Started Guide

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Ready for classroom presentation

---

## 🎯 What You Have

A complete, production-quality quantum mechanics simulation and visualization suite that demonstrates four fundamental quantum systems:

1. **Infinite Potential Well** - Particle in a box (simplest quantum system)
2. **Finite Potential Well** - Realistic walls with evanescent penetration
3. **Harmonic Oscillator** - Mass on a spring (atomic oscillations)
4. **Quantum Tunneling** - Particles penetrating barriers

---

## ⚡ Recent Fix

**Critical Issue**: Quantum solver had a sign convention bug in the kinetic energy matrix  
**Resolution**: Fixed in `src/quantum_playground/solvers.py` (line ~43)  
**Result**: All eigenvalues now positive and physically correct ✅

## 🎓 For Your Class Presentation

### Suggested Flow:
1. Start with **Infinite Well** (simplest, most intuitive)
   - "Particle trapped in a box with no walls"
   - Show discrete energy levels
   - Explain: only specific energies are allowed

2. Move to **Finite Well** (same but realistic)
   - "What if the walls aren't infinitely high?"
   - Show wavefunction penetration
   - Explain: particle found outside the well!

3. Show **Harmonic Oscillator** (most common in nature)
   - "Like a mass on a spring"
   - Equally-spaced energy levels
   - Explain: vibrations of atoms in molecules

4. Finish with **Tunneling** (the WOW factor)
   - "Particles going through barriers!"
   - Show wave packet splitting
   - Explain: why your phone's transistors work

### Talking Points:
- "Classical physics says this shouldn't happen..."
- "But quantum mechanics shows it's not just possible - it's common!"
- "This is the foundation of modern electronics, lasers, nuclear physics..."

## 🎨 Customization Examples

Edit `run_demo.py` to create variations:

```python
# Different well width
iw = InfiniteWellSimulation(well_width=3.0, num_levels=10)

# Higher barrier
fw = FiniteWellSimulation(well_width=2.0, barrier_height=20.0)

# Stronger oscillator (higher frequency)
ho = HarmonicOscillatorSimulation(mass=1.0, omega=2.0)

# Tunneling with different particle energy
tunnel = TunnelingSimulation(barrier_height=5.0, particle_energy=2.0)
```

Then run: `python run_demo.py`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Module not found" | `pip install -e .` |
| Plots look wrong | Use `num_points=512` or `num_points=1024` |

## 📖 Physics Background

### Schrödinger Equation
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi = E\psi$$

This is the master equation of quantum mechanics. Each system solves it numerically with different potentials V(x).

### Key Concepts Visualized

1. **Quantization** - Only certain energies allowed
2. **Superposition** - Wave-like nature of particles
3. **Penetration** - Waves extend beyond classical boundaries
4. **Tunneling** - Probability of finding particle outside barrier
5. **Zero-Point Energy** - Even lowest state has E > 0

---

## ✨ Next Steps

1. ✅ **View the plots** - Open `outputs/` in VS Code
2. ✅ **Run a test** - Execute `python quick_test.py`
3. ✅ **Customize** - Edit parameters in `run_demo.py`
4. ✅ **Present** - Show your class the visualizations!
