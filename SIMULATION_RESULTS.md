## 🎯 Physical Insights

### What the Results Teach

1. **Quantization is Real**
   - Energy levels are discrete, not continuous
   - Explains atomic spectra (why light has specific colors)

2. **Uncertainty Principle in Action**
   - Confined particle has definite probability distribution
   - Cannot know exact position AND momentum simultaneously

3. **Tunneling is Ubiquitous**
   - Particles escape barriers they classically couldn't
   - Enables: radioactive decay, semiconductor tunneling, nuclear fusion

4. **Quantum = Smooth & Wavy**
   - Solutions are smooth functions, not spiky
   - Wavefunctions oscillate with wavelength λ = h/p

5. **Energy is Quantized by Geometry**
   - Well width determines energy spacing
   - Narrower well → higher energy levels → smaller probability density
